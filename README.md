In This Video, We Are Going To Show You Making A Simple 12v Led Flasher Circuit Without IC & Relay. It Is A Very Cheap Electronics Circuit. You Can Make This Led Flasher Circuit At Home Easily & You Can Use This Circuit As Like School Project, College Project Or Any Other Electronics Project. To Make This Led Flasher/ Chase Circuit, You Don't Need Any Kind Of IC & Relay. 
To Make This Simple 12v Led Flasher Circuit, You Might Need Some Electronics Component. 
Those Component List Have To Been Given Below.
Component List :
1. Transistor - Tip41 & BC547
2. Capacitor - 100µf/16v (2 Pieces)
3. Resistor - 10 K Ohm (2 Pieces)
                    & 1 K Ohm
4. LED - 5 Mm (4 Pieces)
5. Power Source - DC 12v 
6. Connection Wire & Soldering Iron

Transistor Pinout : 

Both Transistor Have Different Pinout. First We Need To Know That.
Tip 41 Pinout – NPN Transistor (from left side) – 1 Number Base, 2 Number Collector & 3 Number Emitter
BC 547 Pinout – NPN Transistor (from left side) - 1 Number Collector, 2 Number Base & 3 Number Emitter

First We Connect Both Transistor Emitter. Then Connect Capacitor Negative Leg With Tip41 Transistor Collector And Connect Capacitor Positive Leg With BC547 Transistor Base. Connect 10k Ohm Resistor With BC547 Transistor Base & Connect Another 10k Ohm Resistor With Tip41 Transistor Base. Now Connect 1k Ohm Resistor With Bc547 Transistor Collector. Now You Connect All Resistor’s Empty Terminals. Now Connect Another Capacitor Negative Leg With Tip41 Transistor Base & Connect Capacitor Positive Leg With BC547 Transistor Collector. 
Now Make A Series Connection With 4 Pieces (5mm) Led Light. That Means Connect One Led Negative Leg With Other LED Positive Leg.
 Then Connect Led Light Negative Leg With Tip41 Transistor Collector And Connect Led Light Positive Leg With Where We Connected All Resistor’s Empty Leg.

For Power Source, We Will Use DC-12v. Connect DC-12v Negative Cable With Tip41 Transistor Emitter And Connect DC-12v Positive Cable With Where All Resistor’s Empty Leg Is Connected.

Our Circuit Is Totally Ready For Use. Now Just Power DC-12v Power Supply And Enjoy The Amazing Led Flasher Circuit.
